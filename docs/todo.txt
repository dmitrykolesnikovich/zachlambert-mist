Rough outline of the current state of the project and what
I'm working on.

Purpose of resources, scene, renderer
- Resources: Handles the resources required for rendering, including
    shaders, textures/materials and meshes/models.
- Scene: Handles all the information necessary for defining a scene
    to be rendered, including the camera, lights, and entities, which
    make use of resources.
- Renderer: Take the scene information and render it. No rendering
    logic should be included outside this directory. Other classes should
    only contain the necessary information for rendering.
